<header>The Parable's Relevance Today</header>
<main><text>Like many of Jesus' teachings, this story has a lot more than just the surface interpretation. This is more than a story of a young man fleeing from home to indulge in all manner of sin and recklessness, only to head back to his father after famine strikes swiftly. Moreso, it is an allegory for God's children abandoning Him and His providence. <br><br><blockquote><hl><sup>6</sup> We all, like sheep, have gone astray,
each of us has turned to our own way;
and the Lord has laid on him
the iniquity of us all.</hl></blockquote><br><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ISA.53.6.NIV">Isaiah 53:6</a><br><hr><br>Not only abandoning, but trading the creator of the Universe, and the literal embodiment of perfection, for a life of indulging in hollow desires of the flesh, and when the music stops and the partying ends, everyone who took part are left with nothing.<br><br>
<blockquote><hl><sup>14</sup> After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</hl><hl><sup>15</sup> So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</hl><hl><sup>16</sup> He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</hl></blockquote><br><a href="https://bible.com/bible/111/LUK.15.14-16.NIV">Luke 15:14-16</a><br><hr><br>The next part of the parable can be taken as a very discreet rebuttal to the false idea that detracts many people from Christ: the thought of God being angry and vengeful towards non-believers as they approach Him. The following rejects that claim:<br><br>
<blockquote><hl><sup>20</sup> So he got up and went to his father.</hl>
“But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</hl>
<hl><sup>21</sup> “The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</hl> I am no longer worthy to be called your son.</hl>’
<hl><sup>22</sup> “But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him.</hl> Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.</hl> <hl><sup>23</sup> Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate.</hl> <hl><sup>24</sup> For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.</hl></blockquote><br><br><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/LUK.15.20-24.NIV">Luke 15:20-24</a><br><hr><br></text></main>
