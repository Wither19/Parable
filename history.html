<header>Some Historical Context</header>
<main><text>This is a part of a consecutive series of parables, as told by Jesus that were heard by sinners and religious officials alike, the latter of which seemed rather irritated by his teachings. This likely took place at about 30 A.D. We don't know where exactly he was teaching in this instance, but it could be somewhere near Jerusalem.
